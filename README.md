pi_photo_frame
--------------

A crude program to get pictures from an album on google photos, and download a subset. Makes use of `feh` to display the downloaded files. I imagine it would be simple to change this to use `fbi` if you don't want to use X.
Best used with google photos "smart" albums. You will need to generate a `credentials.json` and `client_secret.json` files.
